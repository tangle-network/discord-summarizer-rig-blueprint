# <h1 align="center">Discord Channel Summarizer Blueprint ü§ñ</h1>

## üìö Overview

This Tangle Blueprint provides an automated Discord channel summarization service using Hyperbolic's AI cloud.

Blueprints are specifications for <abbr title="Actively Validated Services">AVS</abbr>s on the Tangle Network. An AVS is
an off-chain service that runs arbitrary computations for a user-specified period of time.

This blueprint demonstrates how to create an automated AI-powered service that:

- Listens to Discord channels
- Aggregates messages over 24-hour periods
- Generates AI summaries using Hyperbolic through Rig's client adapter
- Posts results on-chain for verification and provenance

For more details, please refer to the [project documentation](https://docs.tangle.tools/developers/blueprints/introduction).

## üöÄ Features

- ü§ñ Automated 24-hour channel summarization
- üîó On-chain result verification
- üß† AI-powered content summarization via Hyperbolic
- ‚ö° Easy operator registration and management
- üìä Transparent job execution tracking

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Forge](https://getfoundry.sh)
- Discord Bot Token
- Hyperbolic API credentials
- Access to Tangle Network (testnet)

You will also need to install [cargo-tangle](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-tangle), our CLI tool for creating and
deploying Tangle Blueprints:

To install the Tangle CLI, run the following command:

> Supported on Linux, MacOS, and Windows (WSL2)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget/releases/download/cargo-tangle-v0.1.2/cargo-tangle-installer.sh | sh
```

Or, if you prefer to install the CLI from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tangle --force # to get the latest version.
```

## ‚≠ê Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
cargo build
```

2. Configure environment variables:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials:
# - DISCORD_TOKEN
# - HYPERBOLIC_API_KEY
# - TANGLE_WS_URL
```

3. Deploy the blueprint to Tangle:

```sh
cargo tangle blueprint deploy
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The blueprint consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contract** (`HelloBlueprint.sol`):

   - Handles operator registration
   - Processes job requests
   - Verifies and stores summarization results

2. **Service Implementation** (`lib.rs`):

   - Defines the summarization job
   - Implements Discord message collection
   - Manages AI summarization calls

3. **Runner** (`main.rs`):
   - Sets up the service context
   - Initializes event listeners
   - Manages the service lifecycle
